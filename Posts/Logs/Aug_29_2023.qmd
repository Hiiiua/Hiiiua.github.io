# Done

-   `classes_dict.json`

    -   Use a json file to read classes, it should be easier to rerun the model if we are training with new scheme, which has more data.

-   `VocDataset`

    -   Use recurssive parsing function

    -   Add `area` key to `target` for future calculating UoI

    -   Add `iscrowd` key to `target` to indicated overlapping objects

-   `Data` directory tree

    -   To make dataset instancing easier

# Todos

## Recent goals

-   Rewrite xml modification function

    -   W/H of the image --\> add a get_height/width function in `VocDataset`

    -   Overlapping information as in `difficult`

    -   Reprocess the xmls

    -   Make sure the boxes are more accurate

-   What to do if "no object" show up when getting the item

-   Remove the rgb in the images

## Future goals

-   Implement the rest of the FasterRcnn

-   Look into TEED

-   Any changes can be made to the receptive field?

-   Optimization?
