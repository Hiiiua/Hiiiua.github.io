    "text": "Done\n\nStart using IntelliJ to take advantage of debugger to read source code.\nFind a good repo that has most thing structured and well-commented. I cloned this repo and made changes to the FasterRCNN project, the main function should mostly work.\n\nMost of fitting work is import-related. Relative path doesn’t work in my project, but I’m worry about importing the whole script will slow down the code running.\nIn train_utils/coco_eval, import torch.six_ to call a string_class doesn’t work because unable to import `torch._six`. This could because of torch version, what i’m currently working on is “2.0.1”.\nSome highlights of this Repo:\n\nCOCO metrics like mAP (Mean Average Precision) has been nicely set up, so I don’t need to spend time recreating the wheels. We should be able quantitatively evaluate our model not only by how the overall detection works, but also by its performance on large/median/small ground truth boxes. These categorized performance report probably will help us to identify whether the “receiptive filed” guess stands a point or not.\nThe whole structure can be easily edited if we have some new ideas of modifying the structure.\n\n\nRead a paper about generating oriented boxes. Basically it’s replacing the RPN part in Faster RCNN with a new network that propose oriented boxes.\n\nMore than just generating 4 box regression parameters for each box, this network generates anotehr rotation angle parameter \\(\\theta\\) to calculate loss.\n\nIt has a coarse box scores that responsible and then refine the parameters to generate proposal regions.\n\nThis network is similar to RNP in terms of positive/ negative sampling to calculate loss.\nSince is is like a “better-RPN”, this network can be easily benchmark to Fast RCNN for training.\nObviously the RoI’s are better, so does the mAP.\n\n\n\n\nTodos\n\nReimplement split_data function\nReimplement a function to modify xml files, so we could have a result as a starting point for the new model.\n\nProbably use an argument to indicate if I want to do oriented proposals.\nReally need to add is_crowd attribute.\nNeed to add get_width and get_height method in my_dataset.\n\nSkimmed at Samia’s project, it’s a decomposition + a GAN model, need to look into the details to get that run with our data.\n\nCould this be an easier replacement?"
